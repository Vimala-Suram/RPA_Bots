# Clothing Consultant Bot

## Overview  
The **Clothing Consultant Bot** is an automated solution developed using **UiPath** that recommends suitable clothing based on the current weather conditions in a user-specified city. By leveraging web automation, the bot fetches live weather data and temperature from Google Search and suggests appropriate outfits â€” for example, warm clothing for cold weather and light attire for hot weather.

## Features  
- Accepts user input for the city name.  
- Automates a web search on Google to retrieve current weather and temperature.  
- Parses weather conditions such as sunny, rainy, snowy, or cloudy.  
- Provides personalized clothing suggestions based on the weather data.

## Requirements  
- UiPath Studio  
- Microsoft Edge browser  
- UiPath Edge Extension enabled  
- Internet connection  

## How It Works  
1. User inputs the city name in the bot interface.  
2. The bot opens Microsoft Edge and navigates to google.com.  
3. It searches for the weather in the specified city.  
4. The bot scrapes temperature and weather condition data.  
5. Based on the data, it recommends suitable clothing options.
